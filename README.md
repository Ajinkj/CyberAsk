# User Experience

The Home page of CyberAsk is given below.

In the Home page there is basic option like login as a existing user, or register as a new user. The main focus of the home page is to show the answered questions. The queries asked by public answered by Expert's. So the visitor's can easily access the answered questions.
Now we can register with CyberAsk with a username and password (later on we will be adding login option like google & facebook login.)

The register page is shown above. Once we register it will automatically take as to login page.

While asking our queries we can choose from a list of expert, to answer our question or we can leave our query to public.

Once we click submit the respective Expert will get that question to be answered. In the expert nav bar their is an additional feature called unanswered questions. The expert can tap on the unanswered question to answer that question.

Once the question is answered by an expert, that question and answer will be shown in the home page.

We have covered about the user experience and the expert experience with CyberAsk, now we also have a control pannel where the admin can make someone a expert and remove as a expert.

By clicking on the user setup page, the admin can make someone expert or remove someone.

# The Build
We build this webapp using flask, html, css, javascript and sqllite as database. If you want to run the CyberAsk locally, you can clone this repository, install all the modules listed in requirements.txt and type the following code.
1) pipenv shell
2) flask run


And that's it now the CyberAsk will be runing in your local machine.
# issue
Due to some trouble with our hosting provider, our app is not loading, so instead of the website link we are providing a detailed video about CyberAsk, like how to use and it's features.

It's just the begining, and we can add on more features to it and make it as successful as Stack-Over-Fow and it's an alarming situation for one like this.
